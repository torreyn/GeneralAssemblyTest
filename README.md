Test for General Assembly
=============

Introduction
------------
This is a test to qualify me for teaching at General Assembly.

Project
-------
* Use Javascript to create a single page app to show and display movie info.
* Use the [http://www.omdbapi.com/] (OMDB API)
* Creat a single page app that will have:
** a search input box
** movie search results
** movie detail portions.

Requirements
------------
* Use either Angular or Jquery to solve this problem. If you would like, you can use some other front end javascript library (Backbone, Ember, React)
* Submit a github link to the project with proper commit messages.

Bonus
-----
* Incorporating Rails
* Use a templating language for displaying the results
* Use routing on your app, via # or pushstate features of javascript.
* Use Bootstrap or Foundation, or design your own html.

Caveat
------
* Some of the images from the movie results are not hotlinkable outside of localhost with The OMDB Api. Don't worry about this for now.
